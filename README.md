# hello-world
Typical first "hello world" example
I started out as a systems analyst maintaining operating systems on mainframes(I know I'm dating myself) and moved into sales for over 20 years. Then I moved into web development and now I am taking the Coursera Data Science Specialization taught by Johns Hopkisn University.
